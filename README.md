## History
I was obsessed with the game Might and Magic and I finally got a copy of it on
NES for a few dollars. I made quite a bit of progress in the game, but the game
would randomly reset all it's progress upon booting it, so I could never get
very far. Finally I became so frustrated I decided that I would program my own
Might and Magic game, and that is when development of EXPLOR began.

I was actually trying to call the game EXPLORE, but in the QBasic days it was
common to hard code graphics by using LINE and PAINT commands, and I found
myself running out of room on the title screen. Rather than starting from
scratch I decided to cut off the title right there and just say it was an
acronym for something. I tacked on the name "A New World" as a tribute to Might
and Magic II, which had the subtitle "Gates to Another World".

Throughout development lots of things were tributes to Might and Magic, in fact
at one point I called the map the player was in Sprogal as a tribute to Sorpigal
from Might and Magic.

I had a lot of big ideas for the game, and it was developed from 2000-2002, with
three different "beta" versions being developed. Each one featured slightly
different technology, and newer versions did not necessarily have more features
than the old ones.

Eventually I started developing EXPLOR again in 2015, and that is the version
available for purchase today, but that's a different story...

You'll note that I have a 2011 and 2020 version (which came after the deveopment
of the final release began) that was because I would occasionally go back to my
old code to see what all I could do better, and it's kind of fun to go back to
my QBasic roots.

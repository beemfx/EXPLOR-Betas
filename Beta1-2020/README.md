The 2011 release of Beta 1, revamped again in 2020.

## Building
This should compile with QBasic 4.5.

## History
Originated: 2020

After fixing up problems in the 2011 version I wanted to see if I could build a
version that would compile with Qbasic 4.5. To do that I had to reduce the
memory footprint of the graphics, so it has a smaller view window, but other
than that it is the same graphics.

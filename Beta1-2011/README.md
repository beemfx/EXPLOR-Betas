The original beta release of EXPLOR revamped in 2011.

## Building
The source code won't compile. This version was specifically designed to compile
and run with QB64, so it may still compile with that.

## History
Originated: 2011

I started doing this version because I had been working professionally for a
while and wanted to see if I could fix some of the issues with the original
beta. I think the biggest thing I did was separate out the logic into different
source files, plus when I made the original game I didn't really know what a
callstack was, so it was made in such a way as that the game would eventually
have a stack overflow error (but the game wasn't worth playing long enough for
that to happen).

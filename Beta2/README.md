The second beta release of EXPLOR.

## Building
EXPLOR.BAS should be compiled with QBasic 4.5.

## History
Originated: Early 2001 

It's hard to say when I started developing this. The earliest log date is for
ExplorED for DOS which is dated January 12, 2001, and based on the comments in
the source code it looks like I started ExplorED before starting the game so I
think that marks the official start.

	Began Development of ExplorED for Windows, only created a window.

	October 31, 2001

	WinExplorED is really coming along.  The interface works fairly correctly.
	I'm having trouble dealing with file input output so I haven't implimented
	most features yet.

	File input is now working.  I had to specifie certain variables as being
	short rather than defaulting to int.  Now if the program is started
	default.map is loaded.  Or you can used a filname as a command line perameter
	if you do that that map will be loaded.  I have not implimented either
	the ability to save or the ability to load when not loading from the start.

	Developing the win port wasn't nearly as hard as I thought it would be.

	November 7, 2001

   Implemented save and save as feature, both work fine.

	December 5, 2001

	Open feature now works.  I need to impliment the new command, and the
	ability to change a property value.

	February 21, 2002

	The tiles[] array is now a pointer.  I use new to allocate  certain amount
	of memory to it.  That way it will have better support for random map sizes.

	I want to do the same for the property[] array, but I know I'm going to have
	more trouble, becuase it is a two dimensional array, rather than one (like the
	tiles array).

	March 06, 2002

	Significant improvments.  The edit board is now a child window.  Bitmaps are displayed
	instead of just painting some stupid tiles.  The GetMessage loop has been changed so
	it works much better, and exits properly.

	I intend to do the property as one long pointer array, all sets together, and gettilestat
	will know how to get the correct values.

	March 07, 2002

	Now the prop is a pointer, all property data is stored in the same pointer.  The first
	set of properties is followed by the second set and so forth.

	Implemented Scroll bars, I'm pretty XXXX proud of myself.  Now the editor will support
	many sized maps with little difficulty.  a definition called EDWNDSIZE gives
	the square size of the visible editing board.  I've set it to 10 for now.

	March 29, 2002

	Now using CreateFile() to open files instead of fopen().

	Algorithm for calculating which coordinates have been edited has been greatly
	improved.

	The size of the Editwindow has been change to fit 10 40x40 bitmap images.  And the tile
	bitmaps have been changed to 40x40.

	June 01, 2002

	The scroll bars have been greatly improved.

	June 02, 2002

	Finally fixed that XXXX bug while running under WindowsXP, the problem was
	that I had the window procs described using WORD instead of WPARAM and long
	instead of LPARAM.  On that note I fixed WinCastle as well.

	NOTE: The following Log applies to the dos version of ExplorED

	January 12, 2001
	I've created a GUI and I'm pretty satisfied.  I'm having troubles dealing
	with sprites and moving them from one function to another.  Using the arrow
	keys is really crappy.  If you press a capitol of the corresponding letter
	it reads it as the up arrow.

	My next goal will be to write a program similar to my QBasic Moveen program
	once I have completed that I may continue to develop this one.

	January 13, 2001
	I perfected the location of the placement of the cursor.  Now it needs an
	input consistent with a x, y format. The cursor now moves fine except that
	it leaves behind a lot of funny pixel formations.

	What needs to be done now is design sprites for different tiles and then
	impliment them by placing them on the map when certain buttons are pressed.

	January 14, 2001
	Now if you press 'T' it places a tile sprite on the screen it doesn't it
	will need to activate the fact that there is a tile at that location for
	the save feature.

	I'm facing many issues with the buffered memory.  I've perfected the binary
	writing but now the cursor disapears for an unexplained reason. My goodness
	I think it's working!  I believe open works correctly it just doesn't
	re-display the tileset. It now opens the tileset fine, but the cursor doesn't
	work quite right.

	The file commands are really screwy.  Save seems to work fine. The rest of
	them create visual errors.

	July 21, 2001
	Removed the necessity for the temb.buf file which cleared up a lot of the
	memory issues.

	But still a lot of memory issues remain.  If you only edit the first map
	loaded and then us SaveAs you can make multiple maps.  NewMap and LoadMap
	cause a lot of errors.  Probably need to redo the graphicsloading to fix
	that.  OpenMap will load the screen correctly but after that the cursor
	gets very screwed up.

	<no longer keeping track of dates>

	BoardEdit has been slighly altered for greater effect.  Updated to map
	type 2.  0's instead of 1's.

	Changed tiles to 'D' 's and 'W' 's for Door and Wall correspondingly.
	Improved the algorithm for mapping out the board when initial map load
	happens.  This improved some of the memory issues.

	Fixed a XXXX good portion of the memory issues.  I'm not even sure if any
	are left.  Have expiramented quite a bit.

	Updated to map type 3 it took a XXXX bit of a long time but I am so XXXXing
	satisfied now.  There are a lot of bugs it will take time to fix them. Most
	bugs are fixed.  I know memory issues exist when saving.  Need to make it so
	alternate tile properties may be altered besides 1 and 2.  To do that need
	to make it so you can change the size of fileHeader.mapNumProperty.

	Wrote a new function that takes input.  It is used to take input for property
	and for new map names, as well as save as.  Works pretty XXXX good.

	Greatly increased the LoadMap function now scrolls down when more than 23
	maps are present.  It supports a maximum number of maps described by a
	definition in openmap.h.

	Preforming a Save causes memory issues.

	One thing to implement.  If escape is pressed while in the LoadMap menu
	the program should return to the previous map, as it was right before the
	LoadMap was called.  Right now it will return to the previous map, but in the
	state it was in when it was last saved.

	I'd also like to implement a screenshot feature.

	Now supports mouse, the mouse doesn't actually do anything yet though.

	October 18, 2001
	I have implemented the EXPLORMAP class which contains all the variables of
	an explor type map, as well as the functions to load an explormap into memory,
	save an explor map on the disk, and edit and explor map.  Mapboard.cpp and
	mapboard.h contain this class and work independently of any other programs.
	Just include #include "mapboard.h" in the file that uses the EXPLORMAP class
   and include the mapboard.cpp as part of the project.

	With this new class it should be much easier to port the code to windows.
	The code in now C++ rather than C language.

	I also separated the source into 3 parts.  One for the defintion of the
	CASTLEMAP class: mapboard.cpp.  Another for the openfile process: openfile.cpp.
	And finally the main program; explored.cpp.

   I also implemented overlaoding functions for the input for easier usage.

/*
	About Explor Map Type 3:

	Explor Maps are read in the following manner:
	The first bytes are the fileheader described by the typedef MAPHEADER.
	Directly after the map data is the tile data.  Each tile is an unsigned int
	which represents the type of tile (see below).  Directly after the tile
	type is the property data.  They are unsigned ints as well.  There may be
	as many properties as you wish per tile.

	Tile types:
		 0: Nothing - Means nothing is there
		10: Wall - Regular wall represented by 'W' on the display
		20: Door - A Door represented by 'D' on the display
	Possible Future Tile types:
		xx: Invisible Wall - Wall you cannot see but cannot pass through
		xx: Visible Emptiness - You see a wall but can pass through

	Property values:
		The property values can be incremented by 1 and 2 on the keyboard.
		They have not been assigned to any specific functions yet.  But may
		either in explor source code or ExplorSCRIPT.
